# Bromite Systemless Webview
	
	ANY PROBLEMS WITH INSTALLATION SHOULD BE REPORTED WITH LOGS AT OUR TELEGRAM GROUP BELOW
	
This module allows you to install [Bromite SystemWebView](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) systemless-ly.
Most useful features of Bromite are that you can block ads, trackers and resist fingerprinting; see the full features list [here](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/blob/master/README.md#features)

The module will always download the latest version of the webview, to update it just reflash the module

The latest update should now work on all ROMs Android v7.0+. Any ROM Android v5.1+ should theoretically be compatible (beware issues on 5.x & 6.x).

## What is a WebView?

A WebView is like a minimal browser, but for non-browsers that display web content in any other way than sending you to a browser or custom tab, apps that use it include Outlook or GoDaddy apps or even some banking apps. Even the Google app uses a webview

**PLEASE NOTE SOME APPS WON'T WORK WITHOUT GOOGLE WEBVIEW**. I can't fix that and any issues on it will be closed and ignored.
