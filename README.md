# Bromite Systemless Webview
	
	FOR ANY PROBLEMS WITH INSTALLATION SHOULD BE REPORTED WITH LOGS AT OUR TELEGRAM GROUP BELOW
	
This module allows you to install [Bromite SystemWebView](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) systemless-ly.
Most useful features of Bromite are that you can block ads, trackers and resist fingerprinting; see the full features list [here](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/blob/master/README.md#features)

The numbers after the dash in the version are the Bromite version used.

## What is a WebView?

A WebView is like a minimal browser, but for non-browsers that display web content in any other way than sending you to a browser or custom tab, like Outlook or GoDaddy apps or even some banking apps.

**PLEASE NOTE SOME APPS WON'T WORK WITHOUT GOOGLE WEBVIEW**. I can't fix that and any issues on it will be closed and ignored.

## Compatibility

- Android 5 or higher
- Magisk v18.2+
- **ONLY FLASH THROUGH MAGISK MANAGER AS IT REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION**

**Please note** your ROM must support using `com.android.webview` as the WebView and not have a pinned signature for the app.

To see if it does:

From termux, under a non root ($) shell:

- cp /system/framework/framework-res.apk ~

- aapt d xmltree framework-res.apk res/xml/config_webview_packages.xml

The output should contain. `com.android.webview` and not contain a "E:" with a bunch of characters under that.
