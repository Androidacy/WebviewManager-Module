<h2>Bromite Systemless Webview</h2>

This module allows you to install Bromite systemlessly. With Bromite, you can block ads and trackers and resist fingerprinting

I didn't develop the app itself; all credit goes to the devs at bromite.org

This module probably won't be updated with each Bromite update but I will try to keep it updated at least with major versions

Donation to the app creators is found at bromite.org. Donation to me is [here](https://paypal.me/innonetlife)

Any issues with Bromite itself should be filed with the Bromite team [here](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues)

Issues with the module are filed [here](https://github.com/alexa-v2/magisk-module-installer/issues)
